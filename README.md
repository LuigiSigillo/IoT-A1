## Info
This repository contains assignments from the [IoT course](http://ichatz.me/Site/InternetOfThings2020) held at Sapienza University during the academic year 2019-2020.

# [IoT first assignement](http://ichatz.me/Site/InternetOfThings2020-Assignment1)
![Scenario](https://i.imgur.com/uK8sw4W.jpg)
This project is focused on the development of an IoT scenario using Azure.
In this repository there is the code of the web app.
To group together also the part of the device virtualization I put inside the simulateDevice folder the script of the virtual device, written in Python.

To know how to use it, look at the [blog-post](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/hands-on-guide-data-visualization-virtualized-iot-devices-sigillo/) on Linkedin.

To see a brief demonstration see [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlIVno4TFOA) youtube video.

# [IoT second assignement](http://ichatz.me/Site/InternetOfThings2020-Assignment2)
![Scenario](https://i.imgur.com/R8YZk42.jpg)
This second part is focused on the development of an IoT scenario using the MQTT-SN protocol and RIOT OS as the client system.

I put inside the emcute_mqttsn folders the main.c of the RIOT-OS systems.
There are two different versions, one for the native board (the virtualized one) and one for the specific m3 board.
